Capturing Dhaka's Vibrant Essence through Cityscapes in Motion:

This project is a C++ computer graphics application that captures the dynamic and vibrant essence of Dhaka through animated cityscapes. The program showcases the bustling life, architectural beauty, and unique atmosphere of Dhaka, bringing the city's energy to life through visual effects and motion.
Features
•	Dynamic Cityscapes: Realistic rendering of Dhaka's city environment with attention to detail in structures and streets.
•	Animation: Smooth transitions and animations to depict movement within the cityscape.
•	Graphics Rendering: Utilizes C++ and computer graphics libraries to create detailed visual effects.
•	User Interaction: Allows user interaction to navigate through different scenes or adjust the view.

Project Structure
•	main.cpp: The core C++ file containing the graphics rendering code and animation logic.
•	resources/: Folder containing textures, models, and other resources used in the rendering.
•	shaders/: Folder containing shader code for advanced rendering effects.

How to Build and Run
Prerequisites
•	A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC)
•	Graphics library (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX) installed
•	Make sure to have the required dependencies installed (e.g., GLFW, GLEW for OpenGL projects)
